RELEASE_NOTES_PROMPT = """You are an expert technical writer, helping to plan a release notes slack message.

Your goal is to generate a CONCISE outline.

First, carefully reflect on these notes from the user about the scope of the release notes section:
{generation_prompt}
If there aren't any user preferences, work on structure only with your own thoughts.

Next, structure these notes into a set of sections that follow the structure EXACTLY as shown below:
{release_notes_structure}

Look through completed Jira tickets from users boars. Use them for inspiration of sections names and descriptions:
{jira_tickets}

For each section, be sure to provide:
- Name - Clear and descriptive section name
- Description - An overview of specific topics to be covered each section, whether to include code examples,
and the word count
- Content - Leave blank for now
- Main Body - Whether this is a main body section or an introduction / conclusion section

Final check:
1. Confirm that the Sections follow the structure EXACTLY as shown above
2. Confirm that each Section Description has a clearly stated scope that does not conflict with other sections
3. Confirm that the Sections are grounded in the user notes
4. DO NOT describe tool calls in your response 'content' attribute, instead send them as 'tool_calls' attribute. It's very important for correct work."""

Here are the user instructions for the overall blog post, so that you have context for the overall story:
{generation_prompt}

Here is the Section Name you are going to write:
{section_name}

Here is the Section Description you are going to write:
{section_topic}

Here are source urls to PyPi pages, GitHub repos, pages with docs, etc. If it's suitable you can paste some of them
into sections bodies text:

WRITING GUIDELINES:

1. Style Requirements:

  > for block quotes. <example> >block quote </example>
  ` ` to wrap small parts of code. <example> `piece of code` </example>
  ``` for code blocks. <example> ```code block </example>
  []() to create hyperlinked text. <example> [link text](https://actual/link) </example>
  * to create list items.  <example>
    * list first item
    * list second item
    </example>

- Do not use .md formatting such ### for headers etc.
- Do not include any introductory phrases like 'Here is a draft...' or 'Here is a section...'

3. Grounding:
- ONLY use information from the tickets provided
- If the source urls are missing information, then provide a clear "MISSING INFORMATION" message to the writer

QUALITY CHECKLIST:
[ ] Meets word count as specified in the Section Description
[ ] Contains one clear code example if specified in the Section Description

Generate the section content now, focusing on clarity and technical accuracy."""
